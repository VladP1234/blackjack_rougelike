**Some info before you start playing**
In text form cause I can't be asked to make a tutorial
1. Each card in your starting deck has an effect if you get blackjack
    - For example, if you have 16 and topdeck a 5 of hearts, then you heal for 5
    - Aces always give 11 worth irrespective of whether they are counted as 1 or 11
    - Hearts heal, clubs dead bonus damage, diamonds inflict bleeding, clubs give temporary hp
2. Merchant cards are broken
    - They have on reveal effects, i.e. whenever you draw the card, you get an effect. Most of them heal you for a lot
3. If you hit "d" during combat, you get to see your upcoming cards (in random order)
4. 'Alties' is a dev deck, use it if you wish to have no fun. Just spam hit and it will give you blackjack every time irrespective of your draw pile
